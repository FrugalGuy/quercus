# The pathname to the Espressif esp-idf tools. 
# NOTE WELL that the aardvrk, the-ant, and triembedtools repos
# will be placed along side esp-idf, not within esp-idf
# The default is installation in the user's home directory
# Todo rename thetools to triembedtools?
# NEED A NAME FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT!!!

targetdir=~

# The git branch label for the exact version of tools to
# install. If this variable does not match the branch of an
# existing esp-idf the script must be aborted because there
# is the likelihood that the submodules are not right.
# The v4.4 branch is the latest Espressif stable branch.
# the v5.0 branch is the bleeding edge branch that is used
# by the Arduino runtime. NOTE that the TriEmbed project is
# currently committed to the stable branch. Also note that
# the v5.0 branch is updated frequently, so it is not safe to
# assume it is stable and frequent git pull operations and
# submodule operations are needed: neither of which are done
# by this script.
