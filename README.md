# League
The League repo pertains to the 2021 TriEmbed open source community project: a development board for the rest of us.
## This repo vs others in TriEmbed:
### Other repos might belong to TriEmbed individuals for their personal projects, a different community project, etc.
## Conventions
1. all directory and filenames names should be lower case to avoid OS filesystem headache to the extent possible (files coming from vendors such as via .zip files may be exceptions)
2. There is a coding style for C++ and C languages enforced by the "formatC" script that invokes astyle. The particular style isn't as important as having one and sticking with it to make collaboration much easier as the group learns and memorizes the common style vs tripping over, pondering, resenting, etc. Go with the flow
