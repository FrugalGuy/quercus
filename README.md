# League
The League repo pertains to theTriEmbed open source community project launched in 2021: a development board for the rest of us.
## This repo vs others in TriEmbed:
### Other repos might belong to TriEmbed individuals for their personal projects, a different community project, etc.
## Conventions
1. All directory and filenames names should be lower case to avoid OS filesystem headaches to the extent possible (files coming from vendors such as via .zip files may be exceptions). When adding new files and directories make them all lower case if possible.
2. Ditto for avoiding embedded spaces or weird characters in director or filenames that one of the big three OS flavors cannot understand, requires quoting, etc. Stick with letters, digits, underscore, hyphens and periods if possible.
3. There is a coding style for C++ and C languages enforced by the "formatC" script that invokes astyle as a front end for the commit dev process. The particular style isn't as important as having one and sticking with it to make collaboration much easier as the group learns and memorizes the common style vs tripping over, pondering, resenting, etc. Go with the flow and thanks in advance!
