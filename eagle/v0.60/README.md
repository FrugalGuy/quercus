# This is the 0.60 version of the ESP32 C3 + SLG47004V-DIP board.

## More notes for the spin

1. Need a minimum of two push buttons and maybe three: reset, go into bootloader mode and ??
2. Need a four position header for I2C connection so the board can be more conveniently used as a progammer.
3. Need three header pins to conveniently connect a USB to serial dongle.
